                  Te food options and responsibilities to consider, the canteens must be better organised and efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of meals prepared, and detalied description of their ingredients help the students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student of staff member who accesses the canteen should be provided with a school canteen account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less comlicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.

              <p class=";igt-group-item-test col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy 
                Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices, automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time recents and mimimize the inevitable and costly errors with anual data entry. This accurate data therety helps to provide accurate performance  and payroll data. 
                <br>
                2. Economics
                Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money bu putting on and to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absentation, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Aesium Group found that large organizations save up to $5,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance managament systems. 
                <br>
                3. Productivity/ Efficiency
                Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be time-comsuming, laborious, and an expensive affair. It takes time to process pager sheets and time cards, create schedule , authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll annually. Free up precious administration time with an automated sustem that does it all for you. From keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information late your payroll system. The time an deffort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of recources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits. And many more like visibility/ insights. Hassle free Workflow Management, flexibility, integration / configuration, meal-time trackiing, security and compliance.
